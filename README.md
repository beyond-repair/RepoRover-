# RepoRover

RepoRover is a Python script designed to gather and process information from GitHub repositories' README.md files. It's a powerful tool for extracting insights into the content of various projects, allowing you to analyze and categorize repositories based on their documentation.

## Features

- **Web Scraping:** Utilizes web scraping techniques to fetch README.md content from GitHub repositories.
- **Content Processing:** Preprocesses the content by performing tasks like lowercasing, HTML tag removal, tokenization, and more.
- **Duplicate Check:** Checks for duplicate entries to ensure data integrity.
- **CSV Output:** Saves processed repository information in a CSV file for easy analysis.

## Usage

1. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    conda install --file requirements.txt
    ```

2. Run the script:

    ```bash
    python RepoRover.py
    ```

3. Analyze the output CSV file (`readmeMD.csv`) containing processed repository data.

## Example

For a demonstration, let's explore the README.md content of a sample repository:

```bash
python RepoRover.py https://github.com/example/example-repo
